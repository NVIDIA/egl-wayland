/*
 * <WAYLAND_EXTERNAL_VERSION_MAJOR>.<WAYLAND_EXTERNAL_VERSION_MINOR>.
 * <WAYLAND_EXTERNAL_VERSION_MICRO> defines the EGL external Wayland
 * implementation version.
 *
 * The includer of this file can override either WAYLAND_EXTERNAL_VERSION_MAJOR
 * or WAYLAND_EXTERNAL_VERSION_MINOR in order to build against a certain EGL
 * external API version.
 *
 *
 * How to update this version numbers:
 *
 *  - WAYLAND_EXTERNAL_VERSION_MAJOR must match the EGL external API major
 *    number this platform implements
 *
 *  - WAYLAND_EXTERNAL_VERSION_MINOR must match the EGL external API minor
 *    number this platform implements
 *
 *  - If the platform implementation is changed in any way, increase
 *    WAYLAND_EXTERNAL_VERSION_MICRO by 1
