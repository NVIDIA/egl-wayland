Wayland EGL External Platform library
=====================================

Overview
--------

This is a work-in-progress implementation of a EGL External Platform library to
add client-side Wayland support to EGL on top of EGLDevice and EGLStream
families of extensions.

This library implements an EGL External Platform interface to work along with
EGL drivers that support the external platform mechanism. More information
about EGL External platforms and the interface can be found at:

https://github.com/NVIDIA/eglexternalplatform


Building and Installing the library
-----------------------------------

This library build-depends on:

 * EGL headers

       https://www.khronos.org/registry/EGL/

 * Wayland libraries & protocols

       https://wayland.freedesktop.org/

 * EGL External Platform interface

       https://github.com/NVIDIA/eglexternalplatform


To build, run:

    ./autogen.sh
    make


To install, run:

    make install


*Notes*:

The NVIDIA EGL driver uses a JSON-based loader to load all EGL External
platforms available on the system.

If this library is not installed as part of a NVIDIA driver installation,
a JSON configuration file must be manually added in order to make the
library work with the NVIDIA driver.

The default EGL External platform JSON configuration directory is:

  `/usr/share/egl/egl_external_platform.d/`

platform.
